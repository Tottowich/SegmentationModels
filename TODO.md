# TODO Segmentation folder
In this folder I want to focus on things related to machine learning models specified on segmentation.

## Project Ideas.
This i want to do:
- [ ] Create a UNet model with cross attention and self attention blocks to segment images. Cross attention is between the encoder and decoder and self attention is within the decoder.

## Current TODOs
### Cross Attention UNet
- [ ] Fully understand the self attention block
- [ ] Fully understand the cross attention block
- [ ] Understand positional encoding, look into learned positional encoding
- [ ] Implement cross attention block
- [ ] Implement self attention block
- [ ] Implement UNet with cross attention and self attention blocks
- [ ] Make cross attention visualizable
- [ ] Make self attention visualizable
