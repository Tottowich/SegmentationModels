# TODO Segmentation folder
In this folder I want to focus on things related to machine learning models specified on segmentation.

## Project Ideas.
This i want to do:
- [x] Create a UNet model with cross attention and self attention blocks to segment images. Cross attention is between the encoder and decoder and self attention is within the decoder.

## Current TODOs
### Attention UNet
- [x] Fully understand the self attention block
- [x] Fully understand the cross attention block
- [x] Understand positional encoding, look into learned positional encoding
- [x] Implement cross attention block
- [x] Implement self attention block
- [x] Implement UNet with cross attention and self attention blocks
- [x] Make cross attention visualizable
- [x] Make self attention visualizable
### Testing
- [x] Create a testing GUI.
- [x] Create a testing script.
- [x] Make model creation easily configurable using GUI.
### Training
- [x] Create a training GUI.
- [x] Create a training script.
- [x] Make model training easily configurable using GUI.
### Data
